\title{
    Calculate Cramer's V (phi) Coefficient
}
\description{
    This functions calculates Cramer's V coefficient
    for overlap of two binary data sets.
}
\usage{
cramerV(sum12, sum1, sum2, len)
}
\arguments{
    \item{len}{
        Total number of elements in each data set.
    }
    \item{sum1}{
        Number of active features in data set 1.
    }
    \item{sum2}{
        Number of active features in data set 1.
    }
    \item{sum12}{
        Number of simultaneously active features in the data sets.
    }    
}

\value{
    Returns the Cramer's V coefficient.
}
\note{
    The parameters can be single values or vectors.

\examples{
# Zero score for perfect independence
cramerV(100,10000,10000,1000000)

# Positive score for increased overlap
cramerV(150,10000,10000,1000000)

# Negative score for decreased overlap
cramerV( 50,10000,10000,1000000)

# We can input a vector for sum12
cramerV(99:101,10000,10000,1000000)
