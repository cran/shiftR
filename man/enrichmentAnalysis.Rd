\title{
    Fast Enrichment Testing via Circular Permutations on Non-Binary Outcomes
}
\description{
    This function performs enrichment analysis on
    two sets of matching test statistics.
    The circular permutation scheme accounts for 
    possible local correlation of test statistcs.
    The testing is performed using the quantile thresholds
    provided for each data set.
    
    For every permutation the enrichment is measure with
    Cramer's V coefficient. The maximum/minimum coefficient
    across all considered thresholds is recorded.
    It is then compared with the maximum/minimum coefficient
    observed without permuting the data.
    
    For matching data sets calculated at different genomic locations
    please use \code{\link{matchDatasets}}.

\usage{
enrichmentAnalysis(
    pvstats1,
    pvstats2,
    percentiles1 = NULL,
    percentiles2 = NULL,
    npermute,
    margin = 0.05,
    threads = 1)
}
\arguments{
    \item{pvstats1}{
        The vector of statistics for primary data set. \cr
        The statistics must be p-value like, i.e. smaller is better.
    }
    \item{pvstats2}{
        The vector of statistics for auxiliary data set. \cr
        The statistics must be p-value like, i.e. smaller is better.
    }
    \item{percentiles1}{
        These quantile thresholds are used to cut off top results 
        in the primary data set
        for matching with the top results in the auxiliary. \cr
        Can be omitted if the vector \code{pvstats1} is binary.
    }
    \item{percentiles2}{
        Same as \code{percentiles1}, but for the other data set.
    }
    \item{npermute}{
        Number of permutations to perform.
    }
    \item{margin}{
        The minimum offset in the circular permutation to consider. \cr
        Can be a fraction of total number of values or
        an integer count of values. \cr
        Passed in the call of \code{\link{getOffsetsRandom}} for
        generation of offsets.
    }
    \item{threads}{
        The number of CPU cores to use for calculations. \cr
        Set to \code{TRUE} to use all cores. \cr
        Multithreading is turned off by default.
    }
}

\value{
    Returns a list with:
    \item{overallPV}{
        The p-values for the overall test across all thresholds. \cr
        The p-values are for enrichment, depletion, and two-sided test for both.
    }
    \item{byThresholdPV}{
        The p-values for tests for each individual threshold. \cr
        The p-values provided for enrichment, depletion, and two-sided test.
    }
